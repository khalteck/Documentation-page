                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host 
                    environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide 
                    programmatic control over them.<br><br>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such 
                    as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing 
                    it with additional objects; for example:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object 
                            Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond 
                            to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
                            For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of 
                            information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <section id="javascript_and_java" class="main-section">
                <h1>Javascript and Java</h1>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles 
                    Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, 
                    naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.<br><br>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on 
                    a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object 
                    model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, 
                    what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative 
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.<br><br>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. 
                    You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement 
                    interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>
                    <div class="grey">
                        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br><br>

                <h1>Variables</h1>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to 
                    certain rules.<br><br>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be 
                    digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the 
                    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).<br><br>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences 
                    as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
                <h1>Declaring Variables</h1>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        var x = 42.
                    </div>
                </code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <code>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        x = 42.
                    </div>
                </code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
                <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <code>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        let y = 13.
                    </div>
                </code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
            </section>
            <br>


            <section id="variable_scope" class="main-section">
                <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other 
                    code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is 
                    available only within that function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local 
                    to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the 
                    scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if 
                    statement.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                    </div>
                </code>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                <code>
                    <div class="grey">
                        if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not<br><br>
                        defined
                    </div>
                </code>

            <br>


            <section id="global_variables" class="main-section">
                <h1>Global Variables</h1>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and 
                    access global variables using the window.variable syntax.<br><br>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying 
                    the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this 
                    variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
                </p>
            </section>
            <br>


            <section id="constants" class="main-section">
                <h1>Constants</h1>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for 
                    a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or 
                    underscore characters.<br>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        const PI = 3.14;
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized 
                    to a value.<br><br>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the 
                    identifier is assumed to represent a variable.<br><br>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:<br>
                    <div class="grey0">
                        // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL<br><br>
                        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements<br><br>
                        }
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
                    <br>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                    </div>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="data_types" class="main-section">
                <h1>Data Types</h1>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Six data types that are primitives:<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li><br>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li><br>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li><br>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li><br>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li><br>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your 
                    applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named 
                    containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="if...else_statement" class="main-section">
                <h1>If...else Statement</h1>
                <p>
                    Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a 
                    statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:<br>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true 
                    and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and 
                    statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.<br><br>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:<br>
                    <div class="grey">
                        if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;<br><br>
                        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute 
                    multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block 
                    statements, especially when nesting if statements:<br>
                    <div class="grey-1">
                        if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br><br>
                            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {<br><br>
                            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br><br>

                    It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with 
                    equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:<br>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around 
                    the assignment. For example:<br>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
                    </div>
                </p>

            <section id="while_statement" class="main-section">
                <h1>While Statement</h1>
                <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
                <code>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        while (condition) statement
                    </div>
                </code>
                <p>
                    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following 
                    the loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed 
                    and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement 
                    following while.
                </p>
                <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
                <code>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }
                    </div>
                </code>
                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li><br>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li><br>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

            <section id="function_declarations" class="main-section">
                <h1>Function Declarations</h1>
                <p>
                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name of the function.</li><br>
                        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li><br>
                        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                    </ul>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:<br>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        function square(number) { return number * number; }
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the 
                    argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by 
                    the function.<br>
                    <div class="grey2">
                        return number * number;
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the 
                    function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
                </p>
